    "3. A sample of dry air has a temperature of 30ºC and a specific volume of 2.0 m$^3$ kg$^{-1}$. What is its pressure?\n",
    "4. The record low observed surface pressure (in Typhoon Tip, 1979) was 870 hPa; the record high (Mongolia, 2001) was 1087 hPa. Air temperature at the surface can easily vary between -40ºC and +50ºC. Find the densities of air corresponding to all four possible combinations of the above extremes.\n",
    "5. Based on your answers above, which of the two variables, pressure or temperature, is typically responsible for the most pronounced variations in the density of air at sea level?"

The containers are connected by a thin tube (negligible volume) that can be opened with a valve. When the valve is opened, the pressures equalize, and the system reequilibrates to room temperature.

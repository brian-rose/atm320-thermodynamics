    "2. By how many psi should the pressure in the tank drop to achieve the target volume?\n",
    "3. Based on conditions in a U.S. Standard Atmospere (see Appendix E.2), what is the approximate diameter of the balloon when it bursts?\n",
    "4. An impatient operator wants to get the sounding over more quickly by overinflating the balloon by 50% (by volume) and thereby increasing the ascent rate. Estimate the new altitude at which the balloon will burst, assuming that the balloon's maximum diameter before bursting does not change. How much altitude is lost?\n",
    "5. Explain why either overinflating or underinflating the balloon might be a bad idea, even if data at higher altitudes are not needed."

    "1. Start by defining a non-dimensional variable $x = \\frac{z}{r_E}$. \n",

    "3. See Appendix C.3 for a refresher on how the series approximation works, for small deviations away from a known reference point.\n",
    "4. Rewrite equation (4.17) in terms of $x$ rather than $z$. Do this by substituting $z = r_E~x$ into the equation and simplifying.\n",
    "5. Use the first-order power series approximation for $g(x)$ about the reference point $x=0$. \n",

    "\n",
    "_(Based on Problem 4.6 of the text)_\n",
    "\n",
    "a) _(3 points)_ Use the equation for $p(z)$ for a _constant density_ atmosphere to calculate the _approximate_ height of the 1000, 850, and 500 hPa levels, _assuming_ that the density thoughout the troposphere is the same as that at the surface (computed from $T_0 = 15$ÂºC and $p_0 = 1013.2$ hPa).\n",

    "c) _(3 points)_ Finally, repeat your calculation using the _most_ accurate expression for $p(z)$, which in this case is the one for a _constant lapse rate_ atmosphere. Assume a lapse rate of $\\Gamma = 6.5 K km$^{-1}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "d) _(3 points)_ Present your results from parts a-c in a _well-formatted and labeled table_ with data in three rows and five columns. Rows should correspond to the three pressure levels. In the first three columns, report the heights you calculated for the three different model atmospheres. In the final two columns, report the errors (approximate minus true value) for the constant density and isothermal atmospheres. Take your result from part c for the constant lapse rate atmosphere as the ``true\" value. Report all values to a precision of 1 meter.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Helpful hints\n",
    "\n",
    "1. For parts a through c, write down the appropriate equation for $p(z)$ (one of 4.33, 4.45, and 4.52). Then derive a _symbolic solution_: Solve the equation for $z$ so that you have an equation for $z(p)$ instead of $p(z)$.\n",
    "2. If you're struggling with how to invert those equations to solve for $z$, remember that there is a nice review of the properties of logs and powers in Appendix C.\n",
    "3. Once you have the symbolic solution, plug in values to calculate height $z$ at each of the three pressure levels.\n",
    "4. For part d, make sure your table is neat and legible, with units clearly labeled."

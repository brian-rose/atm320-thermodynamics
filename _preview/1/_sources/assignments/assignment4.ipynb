    "d) _(2 points)_ For each of the pressure levels given, calculate the errors (approximate minus true value) in meters that results from using the simpler constant density and isothermal approximations. Use a table having the following format to present your results: rows correspond to pressure levels; first three columns correspond to three model atmospheres; final two columns give errors (approximate value minus true) for the constant density and isothermal atmospheres. Record all values to a precision of 1 meter.\n",

    "e) _(3 points)_ For the three model atmosphere (parts a, b, and c): From your 1000 and 850 hPa heights, obtain the layer thicknesses for this pair of pressure levels. Then, invert the hypsometric equation to find the layer mean virtual temperatures $\\overline{T_v}$."

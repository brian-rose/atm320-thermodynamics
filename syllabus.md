Grading (A-E, 3 credit):
: - Homework assignments (roughly 6): 25%
  - In-class quizzes: 10%
  - Two in-class exams: 17.5% each

### Grading policies

Late assignments and off-time exams are only allowed for University-recognized reasons ([https://www.albany.edu/health_center/medicalexcuse.shtml](https://www.albany.edu/health_center/medicalexcuse.shtml)). 

**Homework assignments lose 20% of their value per late day** (i.e., an assignment turned in two days late cannot get better than 60%).

**Exception**: _one late day per student_ to be used at your discretion during the semester.

Percentage grades will be converted into letter grades based on the following formula:

_Formula TBD_

### Textbooks and reading

The **required text** is [_A First Course in Atmospheric Thermodynamics_ by Grant W. Petty, Sundog Publishing, 2008](https://sundogpublishingstore.myshopify.com/products/a-first-course-in-atmospheric-thermodynamics-g-w-petty).

The course will closely follow this book, and students will be reading it cover-to-cover. Having your own copy is highly recommended. One copy will be on reserve at the Science Library.

Reading assignments will be clearly posted on the [schedule page of the course website](schedule). The reading is required, and must be **completed before class** on the day indicated. It is important for every student to keep up with this schedule.

Students may also want to consult the excellent book [_Atmospheric Science: An Introductory Survey_, 2nd ed. by J. M. Wallace and P. V. Hobbs, Academic Press 2006](https://shop.elsevier.com/books/atmospheric-science/wallace/978-0-12-732951-2) for supplementary reading.

### Quizzes and Exams

To encourage students to keep up with the assigned reading schedule, a pop quiz will occasionally be given in class. Dates will not be announced in advance. Quizzes will be given in the first 5 minutes of class.

There will be two in-class exams and a final exam during the University exam period (dates posted on the [schedule page of the course website](schedule)). 


### Academic integrity

Although students may work together, all homework assignments must be completed independently. Homework assignments that are substantially similar to other students will receive a zero for that assignment. Copying from other students on quizzes and exams may result in a zero for that work and referral for disciplinary action.

It is every student's responsibility to become familiar with the standards of academic integrity at UAlbany. Claims of ignorance, of unintentional error, or of academic or personal pressures are not sufficient reasons for violations of academic integrity. Please refer to the UAlbany academic integrity policies here: [https://www.albany.edu/undergraduate_bulletin/regulations.html](https://www.albany.edu/undergraduate_bulletin/regulations.html)

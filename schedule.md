# Class schedule

Here you can find the subject matter and assigned reading for every class day as well as expected homework dates.

**Please check back here frequently** as the schedule is subject to change.

The class meets **every Monday, Wednesday, Friday 10:35 - 11:30 AM** in **ETEC 482**.

The course outline closely follows the chapters in the book [_A First Course in Atmospheric Thermodynamics_ by Grant W. Petty, Sundog Publishing, 2008](https://sundogpublishingstore.myshopify.com/products/a-first-course-in-atmospheric-thermodynamics-g-w-petty)

*Note that exact due dates / times are given on Brightspace! The reading assignments are typically due by **11:59 pm the night before** we begin covering the material in class.*

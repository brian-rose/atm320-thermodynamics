    "## Question 2\n",
    "\n",
    "_(Problem 4.6 of the text)_\n",
    "\n",
    "a) Use the equation for $p(z)$ for a _constant density_ atmosphere to calculate the _approximate_ height of the 1000, 850, and 500 hPa levels, _assuming_ that the density thoughout the troposphere is the same as that at the surface (computed from $T_0 = 15$ºC and $p_0 = 1013.2$ hPa).\n",
    "\n",
    "b) Repeat your calculation using the somewhat more accurate expression for $p(z)$ in an _isothermal_ atmosphere, _assuming_ that the temperature of the entire atmosphere equals $T_0$ as given above.\n",
    "\n",
    "c) Finally, repeat your calculation using the _most_ accurate expression for $p(z)$, which in this case is the one for a _constant lapse rate_ atmosphere.\n",
    "\n",
    "d) For each of the pressure levels given, calculate the errors (approximate minus true value) in meters that results from using the simpler constant density and isothermal approximations. Use a table having the following format to present your results: rows correspond to pressure levels; first three columns correspond to three model atmospheres; final two columns give errors (approximate value minus true) for the constant density and isothermal atmospheres. Record all values to a precision of 1 meter.\n",
    "\n",
    "e) From your 1000 and 850 hPa heights, obtain the layer thicknesses for this pair of pressure levels. Then, invert the hypsometric equation to find the layer mean virtual temperatures $\\overline{T_v}$ for the three model atmospheres."

    "b) If $T_1 = 280$ K and $T_2 = 276$ K, find $\\overline{T}$ to the nearest 0.1 K. Compare your result with a mean temperature derived from the much simpler arithmetic average of $T_1$ and $T_2$ _(add them together and divide by two)_\n",

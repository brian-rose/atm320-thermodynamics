## Grading 

### Grading scheme (A-E, 3 credit)
- Homework assignments (roughly 6): 30%
- Reading responses: 10%
- Two in-class exams: 15% each
- Final exam: 30%

_The final exam will be held Thursday December 7 2023, 10:30 am - 12:30 pm)_

### Grading policies

- Late assignments and off-time exams are only allowed for University-recognized reasons (<https://www.albany.edu/health_center/medicalexcuse.shtml>)
- **Homework assignments lose 20% of their value per late day** (i.e., an assignment turned in two days late cannot get better than 60%).
    - **Exception**: _one late day per student_ to be used at your discretion during the semester.
- Percentage grades will be converted into letter grades based on the following formula:

_Formula TBD_


## Textbooks and reading

The **required text** is [_A First Course in Atmospheric Thermodynamics_ by Grant W. Petty, Sundog Publishing, 2008](https://sundogpublishingstore.myshopify.com/products/a-first-course-in-atmospheric-thermodynamics-g-w-petty).

The course will closely follow this book, and students will be reading it cover-to-cover. Having your own copy is highly recommended. One copy will be on reserve at the Science Library.

Reading assignments will be clearly posted on the [schedule page of the course website](schedule). The reading is required, and must be **completed before class** on the day indicated. It is important for every student to keep up with this schedule.

Students may also want to consult the excellent book [_Atmospheric Science: An Introductory Survey_, 2nd ed. by J. M. Wallace and P. V. Hobbs, Academic Press 2006](https://shop.elsevier.com/books/atmospheric-science/wallace/978-0-12-732951-2) for supplementary reading.

### Quizzes and Exams

To encourage students to keep up with the assigned reading schedule, a pop quiz will occasionally be given in class. Dates will not be announced in advance. Quizzes will be given in the first 5 minutes of class.

There will be two in-class exams and a final exam during the University exam period (dates posted on the [schedule page of the course website](schedule)). 


## Academic integrity

Although students may work together, all homework assignments must be completed independently. Homework assignments that are substantially similar to other students will receive a zero for that assignment. Copying from other students on quizzes and exams may result in a zero for that work and referral for disciplinary action.

It is every student's responsibility to become familiar with the standards of academic integrity at UAlbany. Claims of ignorance, of unintentional error, or of academic or personal pressures are not sufficient reasons for violations of academic integrity. Please refer to the UAlbany academic integrity policies here: [https://www.albany.edu/undergraduate_bulletin/regulations.html](https://www.albany.edu/undergraduate_bulletin/regulations.html)


## Mental Health and Well-being

As a student, there may be times when personal stressors interfere with your academic performance and/or negatively impact your daily life. The University at Albany Counseling and Psychological Services (CAPS) provides free, confidential services including individual and group psychological counseling and evaluation for emotional, social and academic concerns. Students may consult with CAPS staff remotely by telephone, email or Zoom appointments regarding issues that impact them or someone they care about.  For questions or to make an appointment, call (518) 442-5800 or email consultation@albany.edu.  Visit <https://www.albany.edu/health-well-being/mental-health/caps> for hours of operation and additional information
 
If your life or someone else’s life is in danger, please call 911. If you are in a crisis and need help right away, please call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 988.
Students dealing with heightened feelings of sadness or hopelessness, increased anxiety, or thoughts of suicide may also text “HOME” to 741741 (Crisis Text Line).

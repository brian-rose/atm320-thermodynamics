## A ATM 320: Atmospheric Thermodynamics (Fall 2023)

### Course information

Class number:
: 5299

Meeting time:
: Monday / Wednesday / Friday 10:35 - 11:30 AM in ETEC 482

Instructor:
: [Brian Rose](https://www.atmos.albany.edu/facstaff/brose/) (office is ETEC 425)

Office hours:
: TBD

Course Objective:
The goal of this course is to understand the physical laws that govern how energy and heat are transmitted in the atmosphere.

Prequisites:
ATM 211

Grading: A-E, 3 credit
- Homework assignments (roughly 6): 25%
- In-class quizzes: 10%
- Two in-class exams: 17.5% each
- Final exam (Thursday December 7 2023, 10:30 am - 12:30 pm): 30%
- Term project and presentation: 40%

Late assignments and off-time exams are only allowed for University-recognized reasons ([https://www.albany.edu/health_center/medicalexcuse.shtml](https://www.albany.edu/health_center/medicalexcuse.shtml)). Homework assignments lose 20% of their value per day it is late (i.e., an assignment turned in two days late cannot get better than 60%).

Exception: one late day per student to be used at your discretion during the semester.

<!-- ### Course description

The course will explore fundamental questions about why the circulation looks the way it does, bringing together observations, theory, and models. The [bulletin description](https://www.albany.edu/graduatebulletin/a_atm.htm) says

> Processes which maintain the general circulation of the Earth's atmosphere; investigation of observed angular momentum, energy and water vapor budgets of the atmosphere; atmospheric energetics; application of numerical methods to studies of the general circulation.

Our approach will be hands-on and data-centric wherever possible. We will put significant emphasis on reproducible workflows to generate the maps and diagnostics we look at. So in addition to fundamental science, the course should arm you with a useful toolkit of modern Python-based analysis tools. We will also spend some time in the new Fluids lab carrying out rotating tank experiments to complement the observations and theory. -->

### Academic integrity

Although students may work together, all homework assignments must be completed independently. Homework assignments that are substantially similar to other students will receive a zero for that assignment. Copying from other students on quizzes and exams may result in a zero for that work and referral for disciplinary action.

It is every student's responsibility to become familiar with the standards of academic integrity at UAlbany. Claims of ignorance, of unintentional error, or of academic or personal pressures are not sufficient reasons for violations of academic integrity.

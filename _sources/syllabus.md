## Grading 

### Grading scheme (A-E, 3 credit)
- Homework assignments (roughly 6): 30%
- Reading responses: 10%
- Two in-class exams: 15% each
- Final exam: 30%

_The final exam will be held Thursday December 7 2023, 10:30 am - 12:30 pm)_

### Grading policies

- Late assignments and off-time exams are only allowed for University-recognized reasons (<https://www.albany.edu/health_center/medicalexcuse.shtml>)
- **Homework assignments lose 20% of their value per late day** (i.e., an assignment turned in two days late cannot get better than 60%).
    - **Exception**: _one late day per student_ to be used at your discretion during the semester.
- Percentage grades will be converted into letter grades based on the following formula:
    - A > 87.0
    - 83.3 < A- ≤87.0
    - 79.6 < B+ ≤83.3
    - 75.9 < B ≤79.6
    - 72.2 < B- ≤75.9
    - 68.5 < C+ ≤72.2
    - 64.8 < C ≤ 68.5
    - 61.1 < C- ≤ 64.8
    - 57.4 < D+ ≤ 61.1
    - 53.7 < D ≤ 57.4
    - 50.0 < D- ≤ 53.7 
    - E ≤ 50.0 


## Textbooks and reading

### Required text

The **required text** is [_A First Course in Atmospheric Thermodynamics_ by Grant W. Petty, Sundog Publishing, 2008](https://sundogpublishingstore.myshopify.com/products/a-first-course-in-atmospheric-thermodynamics-g-w-petty).

The course will closely follow this book, and students will be reading it cover-to-cover. Having your own copy is highly recommended. One copy will be on reserve at the Science Library.

### Reading assignments

Reading assignments will be clearly posted on Brightspace. The reading is required, and must be **completed before class** on the day indicated. It is important for every student to keep up with this schedule.

To incentivize this, 10% of the course grade is given for reading responses. We will use a Discussion Board on Brightspace for this purpose. To earn their full 10%, each student must **post at least one substantive comment, question, or response** on the Discussion board for every assigned reading unit.


### Other useful reading

Students may also want to consult the excellent book [_Atmospheric Science: An Introductory Survey_, 2nd ed. by J. M. Wallace and P. V. Hobbs, Academic Press 2006](https://shop.elsevier.com/books/atmospheric-science/wallace/978-0-12-732951-2) for supplementary reading.

## Homework assignments

Homework assignments will form an essential part of the learning process in this course. Assignments will require students to apply concepts and methods developed in class and in the required reading to solving quantitative problems in atmospheric thermodynamics. 

In some cases, assigned problems may require students to access some observed data and carry out some computer-based analysis. We will provide plenty of guidance on any required computations. No special software beyond a web browser will be needed for this work.

Assignments will be handed out in class, with due dates visible on Brightspace. Assignments will typically be due one week after they are handed out. Assignments are **due by the beginning of class** on the stated due date.

Students may hand in their work on paper at the beginning of class, or electronically via Brightspace. Either way, students are responsible for making sure that their work is **legible** and **clearly communicated**.

We will provide substantial guidance on the principes of physical problem solving, and hold students to a high standard of clarity.

Both the TA and instructor will hold regular office hours each week for help outside of class time.


## Exams

There will be **two in-class mid-term exams** and a **final exam** during the University exam period. 

_Tentative dates_ for the mid-term exams are:
- Friday September 29
- Friday November 3

Dates are subject to change, but will be posted on Brightspace and announced numerous times. 

The Final Exam will be held Thursday December 7 10:30 am - 12:30 pm (per the [University exam calendar](https://livealbany.sharepoint.com/sites/web_registrar/Shared%20Documents/Forms/AllItems.aspx?id=%2Fsites%2Fweb%5Fregistrar%2FShared%20Documents%2FFinal%20Exams%2FFall%202023%20Final%20Exam%20Schedule%20for%20Web%2Epdf&parent=%2Fsites%2Fweb%5Fregistrar%2FShared%20Documents%2FFinal%20Exams&p=true&ga=1))


## Academic integrity

Although students may work together, all homework assignments must be completed independently. Homework assignments that are substantially similar to other students will receive a zero for that assignment. Copying from other students on quizzes and exams may result in a zero for that work and referral for disciplinary action.

It is every student's responsibility to become familiar with the standards of academic integrity at UAlbany. Claims of ignorance, of unintentional error, or of academic or personal pressures are not sufficient reasons for violations of academic integrity. Please refer to the UAlbany academic integrity policies here: [https://www.albany.edu/undergraduate_bulletin/regulations.html](https://www.albany.edu/undergraduate_bulletin/regulations.html)


## Mental Health and Well-being

As a student, there may be times when personal stressors interfere with your academic performance and/or negatively impact your daily life. The University at Albany Counseling and Psychological Services (CAPS) provides free, confidential services including individual and group psychological counseling and evaluation for emotional, social and academic concerns. Students may consult with CAPS staff remotely by telephone, email or Zoom appointments regarding issues that impact them or someone they care about.  For questions or to make an appointment, call (518) 442-5800 or email consultation@albany.edu.  Visit <https://www.albany.edu/health-well-being/mental-health/caps> for hours of operation and additional information
 
If your life or someone else’s life is in danger, please call 911. If you are in a crisis and need help right away, please call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 988.
Students dealing with heightened feelings of sadness or hopelessness, increased anxiety, or thoughts of suicide may also text “HOME” to 741741 (Crisis Text Line).
